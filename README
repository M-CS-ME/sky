Sky: A λ-Calculus Interpreter
=============================

Sky is an interpreter for the untyped λ-calculus, written in python for my own amusement.

It uses list substitution (replacing all instaces of x in a list with y) and a metacircular evaluator: https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-26.html#%_sec_4.1

Todo
====

1. Environment for Variables (typing λ-expressions is hard)
2. α-equivalence
3. Module System
4. Better syntax

The last two are pretty hard, I hope I have the patience to do them.
