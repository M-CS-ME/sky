Sky: A λ-Calculus Interpreter
=============================

Sky is an interpreter for the untyped λ-calculus, written in python for my own amusement.

It uses β-reduction and an evaluator similar to: https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-26.html#%_sec_4.1

Rewrite in Scheme/Haskell? Should I?

Todo
====

1. Environment for Variables (typing λ-expressions is hard)
2. α-equivalence
3. Module System
4. Better syntax

The last two are pretty hard, I hope I have the patience to do them.

Tutorial
========

If you are not familiar with the λ-calculus, checkout Peter Selinger's lecture notes: https://arxiv.org/abs/0804.3434 . The first few chapters should be enough to get you started.

The syntax is as follows (for now):

      +----------+---------------+
      | λ-expr   | Sky syntax    |
      +----------+---------------+
      | λxy.x    | (\ (x y) x)   |
      +----------+---------------+
      | MN       | (M N)         |
      +----------+---------------+

You may have realized that this is similar to scheme's syntax (parsing s-exprs is MUCH easier than parsing anything else), and that is true, the only difference is that lambdas are represented with either a "\" or a "λ" as opposed to "lambda"
