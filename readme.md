# Sky: A λ-Calculus Interpreter

Little project in implementing some λ-calculus bits. What I'm planning to 
eventually do is to make:

1. [ ] An untyped λ-calculus interpreter.
2. [ ] A lisp->λ compiler with recursion for funsies.
3. [ ] A simply-typed λ-calc interpreter.

I'm intending to follow the formal definitions as closely as possible. Maybe 
I'll rewrite this in Coq someday so I can prove some things about it formally 😛
